## Project Overview: Building a Dynamic Web Page with HTML, CSS, JS, and GSAP

This project involves the use of HTML, CSS, JS, and GSAP to create a dynamic web page. By following these simple steps, you can easily modify the existing project or create a new one with your own style.

# Instructions:

Customize Sections: The project contains multiple sections with the ID "#page". You can easily modify and style these sections according to your preference. Experiment with different layouts, colors, and content to make the page unique to your vision.
    
Video to Canvas Animation: If you have a video you'd like to incorporate into your web page, consider converting it into sequenced image frames. This can be done by extracting individual frames from the video and saving them as images. Once you have the image frames, you can use HTML5 Canvas and GSAP to create captivating animations with them. This technique allows for smoother and more dynamic playback of the video content on your web page.

By combining your creativity with HTML, CSS, JS, and GSAP, you can achieve impressive results and bring your web page to life with engaging animations and personalized designs. Happy coding!
